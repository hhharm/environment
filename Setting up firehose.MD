Instructions are missing important parts :\

# Preconditions:

The IDE/text editor of your choice, such as WebStorm, Atom, Sublime, or VS Code
The package manager npm, which typically comes with Node.js
A terminal/console
A browser of your choice, such as Chrome
The codelab's sample code (See the next step of the codelab for how to get the code.)

Firebase CLI
`npm install firebase`

Emulation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure
Node.js 16+
Java! JDK 11+ for emulation https://jdk.java.net/21/

`firebase use --add`
`firebase init emulators` - it will download needed jre :\

I couldn't run this in my bash, doesn't see java even though it's added to path.

Running in powershell, but note - need to run like `npx firebase bla-bla-bla`
