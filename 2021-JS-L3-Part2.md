#### Performance
###### topics:

Critical Rendering Path (how browser renders page);

High performant animations, repaint/reflow, layout thrashing;

Improve loading performance and CRP (lazy loading, priority of the sources, gzip, minification/uglification);

RAIL Model. Animation (fps), Click Response time, etc.;

PRPL pattern;

Performance measurement and profiling (Chrome Dev Tools, Lighthouse, PageSpeed);

Network optimizations (images, gzipping, bundling, etc.);

Improving user perception with layout placeholders, async/defer for not blocking the browser;

HTTP how web browsers load a web resources. lazy loading and resource pre-loading;

CPU bound operations optimizations;

Web workers;

Service workers;

Memory leaks detection;

V8 hidden classes and inline caching techniques;
