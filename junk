What I want to create:

I want to visualise NgRx as a game.

We've got roles: main hero, StoreKeeper (aka reducer), store (aka store)), curiers (aka actions), store keeper friends (aka effects), treasure (aka data), 
treasure map (aka observers).

The goal of the game is to build castle. 

1) Need to get money via treasure & treasure map.
2) Need to put them to store (via store, etc)
3) Need to hire workers (via store,etc + effects)
4) Need to buy resources
